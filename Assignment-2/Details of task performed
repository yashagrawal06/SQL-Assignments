Details:
The creators of Silicon Valley have provided you with the following details regarding the
structure of the show:
• The show is comprised of episodes. Each episode has a title, a plot synopsis, a unique
episode number, and an original broadcast date. Each episode is written by one or
more writers, stars several actors, and is produced by one or more producers.
• Writers have a name and an email address, while producers have a name and an office
number.
• Several characters appear in each episode. Each character is classified as primary,
secondary, or tertiary. Primary characters appear in most of the episodes, secondary
characters appear in at least two episodes, and tertiary characters appear in only one
episode. Additional character classifications may be added in the future.
• NOTE: The database itself does not need to automatically assign character
categories, but it should be able to keep track of which characters belong to
each category.
• Each character has a name and a description, and is portrayed by an actor.
• Actors have a name and an agent phone number. The creators of the series would like
actors and characters to be tracked separately in the database.
• For purposes of simplicity, you may assume that each actor plays just one character,
and that each character is played by just one actor.
